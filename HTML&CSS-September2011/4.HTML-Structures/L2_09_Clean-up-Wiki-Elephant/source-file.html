    <p>The <b>elephants</b> are the large mammals forming the family <a

            title="Asian elephant">Asian elephant</a> (<i>Elephas maximus</i>). Elephants are scattered
        throughout <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub-Saharan_Africa" title="Sub-Saharan Africa">sub-Saharan

            Asia</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asia" title="Southeast Asia">Southeast
            Asia</a>. Elephantidae is the only surviving family of the order Proboscidea; other, now
        extinct, members of the order include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deinotheriidae"
            title="Deinotheriidae">deinotheres</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gomphothere"

            title="Mammoth">mammoths</a>,
        and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastodon" title="Mastodon">mastodons</a>.
    </p>
    <p>All elephants have several distinctive features, the most notable of which is a long trunk (also
        called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proboscis" title="Proboscis">proboscis</a>),
        used for many purposes, particularly breathing, lifting water, and grasping objects. Their <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incisor" title="Incisor">incisors</a> grow into tusks,
        which can serve as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging. Elephants' large ear
        flaps help to control their body temperature. Their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Column"
            title="Column">pillar</a>-like legs can carry their great weight. African elephants have
        larger ears and concave backs while Asian elephants have smaller ears and convex or level
        backs.
    </p>
    <p>Elephants are herbivorous and can be found in different habitats including <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savanna" title="Savanna">savannahs</a>, forests, deserts, and <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marsh" title="Marsh">marshes</a>. They prefer to stay near water. They
        are considered to be a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keystone_species"
            title="Keystone species">keystone
            species</a> due to their impact on their environments. Other animals tend to keep their
        distance from elephants while predators, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lion"
            title="Lion">lions</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger" title="Tiger">tigers</a>,

            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canidae" title="Canidae">wild dogs</a>, usually target only young
        elephants (or "calves"). Elephants
        have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fission%E2%80%93fusion_society"
            title="Fission–fusion society">fission–fusion
            society</a> in which multiple family groups come together to socialise. Females ("cows")
        tend to live in family groups, which can consist of one female with her calves or several
        related females with offspring. The groups are led by an individual known as the <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matriarchy" title="Matriarchy">matriarch</a>, often the oldest cow.
    </p>
    <p>Males ("bulls") leave their family groups when they reach puberty and may live alone or with
        other males. Adult bulls mostly interact with family groups when looking for a mate and enter a
        state of increased <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testosterone" title="Testosterone">testosterone</a>
        and aggression known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musth" title="Musth">musth</a>,

            title="Dominance (ethology)">dominance</a>
        and reproductive success. Calves are the centre of attention in their family groups and rely on
        their mothers for as long as three years. Elephants can live up to 70 years in the wild. They
        communicate by touch, sight, smell, and sound; elephants use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrasound"

            title="Polyphyodont">polyphyodonts</a> that have cycles of tooth rotation throughout their
        lives. The chewing teeth are replaced six times in a typical elephant's lifetime. Teeth are not
        replaced by new ones emerging from the jaws vertically as in most mammals. Instead, new teeth
        grow in at the back of the mouth and move forward to push out the old ones. The first chewing
        tooth on each side of the jaw falls out when the elephant is two to three years old. The second
        set of chewing teeth falls out at four to six years old. The third set falls out at 9–15 years
        of age, and set four lasts until 18–28 years of age. The fifth set of teeth falls out at the
        early 40s. The sixth (and usually final) set must last the elephant the rest of its life.
        Elephant teeth have loop-shaped dental ridges, which are thicker and more diamond-shaped in
        African elephants.<sup id="cite_ref-Shoshani70_76-0" class="reference"><a

    <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Tusks">Tusks</span></h4>

    <p>The tusks of an elephant are modified second incisors in the upper jaw. They replace deciduous
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk_teeth" class="mw-redirect" title="Milk teeth">milk
            teeth</a> at 6–12 months of age and grow continuously at about 17&nbsp;cm (7&nbsp;in) a
        year. A newly developed tusk has a smooth <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth_enamel"
            title="Tooth enamel">enamel</a> cap that eventually wears off. The <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentin" title="Dentin">dentine</a> is known as <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivory" title="Ivory">ivory</a>
        and its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_section_(geometry)"
            title="Cross section (geometry)">cross-section</a>
        consists of crisscrossing line patterns, known as "engine turning", which create diamond-shaped
        areas. As a piece of living tissue, a tusk is relatively soft; it is as hard as the mineral <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcite" title="Calcite">calcite</a>. Much of the tusk
        can be seen outside; the rest is in a socket in the skull. At least one-third of the tusk
        contains the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulp_(tooth)" title="Pulp (tooth)">pulp</a>
        and some have nerves stretching to the tip. Thus it would be difficult to remove it without
        harming the animal. When removed, ivory begins to dry up and crack if not kept cool and moist.
        Tusks serve multiple purposes. They are used for digging for water, salt, and roots; debarking
        or marking trees; and for moving trees and branches when clearing a path. When fighting, they
        are used to attack and defend, and to protect the trunk.<sup id="cite_ref-Shoshani71_77-0" class="reference"><a

            or left-handed</a>, elephants are usually right- or left-tusked. The dominant tusk, called
        the master tusk, is generally more worn down, as it is shorter with a rounder tip. For the
        African elephants, tusks are present in both males and females, and are around the same length
        in both sexes, reaching up to 3&nbsp;m (10&nbsp;ft),<sup id="cite_ref-Shoshani71_77-1" class="reference"><a

    <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Skin">Skin</span></h3>

    <p>An elephant's skin is generally very tough, at 2.5&nbsp;cm (1&nbsp;in) thick on the back and
        parts of the head. The skin around the mouth, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anus"
            title="Anus">anus</a>, and inside of the ear is considerably thinner. Elephants typically
        have grey skin, but African elephants look brown or reddish after wallowing in coloured mud.
        Asian elephants have some patches of depigmentation, particularly on the forehead and ears and
        the areas around them. Calves have brownish or reddish hair, especially on the head and back.
        As elephants mature, their hair darkens and becomes sparser, but dense concentrations of hair
        and bristles remain on the end of the tail as well as the chin, <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_organ" title="Sex organ">genitals</a> and the areas around the eyes
        and ear openings. Normally the
        skin of an Asian elephant is covered with more hair than its African counterpart.<sup

    <p>An elephant uses mud as a sunscreen, protecting its skin from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet"
            title="Ultraviolet">ultraviolet</a> light. Although tough, an elephant's skin is very
        sensitive. Without regular <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mud_bath" title="Mud bath">mud
            baths</a> to protect it from burning, insect bites and moisture loss, an elephant's skin
        suffers serious damage. After bathing, the elephant will usually use its trunk to blow dust
        onto its body and this dries into a protective crust. Elephants have difficulty releasing heat
        through the skin because of their low <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface-area-to-volume_ratio"
            title="Surface-area-to-volume ratio">surface-area-to-volume ratio</a>, which is many times

    <p>To support the animal's weight, an elephant's limbs are positioned more vertically under the

    <p>Some elephant populations in India and Sri Lanka have similar basic social organisations. There
        appear to be cohesive family units and loose aggregations. They have been observed to have
        "nursing units" and "juvenile-care units". In southern India, elephant populations may contain
        family groups, bond groups and possibly clans. Family groups tend to be small, consisting of
        one or two adult females and their offspring. A group containing more than two adult females
        plus offspring is known as a "joint family". Malay elephant populations have even smaller
        family units, and do not have any social organisation higher than a family or bond group.
        Groups of African forest elephants typically consist of one adult female with one to three
        offspring. These groups appear to interact with each other, especially at forest clearings.<sup

    <p>The social life of the adult male is very different. As he matures, a male spends more time at
        the edge of his group and associates with outside males or even other families. At Amboseli,
        young males spend over 80% of their time away from their families when they are 14–15. When
        males permanently leave, they either live alone or with other males. The former is typical of
        bulls in dense forests. Asian males are usually solitary, but occasionally form groups of two
        or more individuals; the largest consisted of seven bulls. Larger bull groups consisting of
        over 10 members occur only among African bush elephants, the largest of which numbered up to
        144 individuals.<sup id="cite_ref-Sukumar179_121-0" class="reference"><a

    <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Musth">Musth</span></h4>

    <p>Adult males enter a state of increased <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testosterone"
            title="Testosterone">testosterone</a> known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musth"
            title="Musth">musth</a>. In a population in southern India, males first enter musth at the
        age of 15, but it is not very intense until they are older than 25. At Amboseli, bulls under 24
        do not go into musth, while half of those aged 25–35 and all those over 35 do. Young bulls
        appear to enter musth during the dry season (January–May), while older bulls go through it
        during the wet season (June–December). The main characteristic of a bull's musth is a fluid
        secreted from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporin" title="Temporin">temporal
            gland</a> that runs down the side of his face. He may urinate with his penis still in his
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penile_sheath" title="Penile sheath">sheath</a>, which
        causes the urine to spray on his hind legs. Behaviours associated with musth include walking
        with the head held high and swinging, picking at the ground with the tusks, marking, rumbling
        and waving only one ear at a time. This can last from a day to four months.<sup id="cite_ref-Sukumar100_124-0"
            class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-Sukumar100-124">[124]</a></sup>
    </p>
    <p>Males become extremely aggressive during musth. Size is the determining factor in <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agonistic_behaviour" title="Agonistic behaviour">agonistic</a>
        encounters when the individuals have the same
        condition. In contests between musth and non-musth individuals, musth bulls win the majority of
        the time, even when the non-musth bull is larger. A male may stop showing signs of musth when
        he encounters a musth male of higher rank. Those of equal rank tend to avoid each other.
        Agonistic encounters typically consist of threat displays, chases, and minor sparring with the
        tusks. Serious fights are rare.<sup id="cite_ref-Sukumar100_124-1" class="reference"><a

    <p>For the first few days, the newborn is unsteady on its feet, and needs the support of its
        mother. It relies on touch, smell, and hearing, as its eyesight is poor. It has little precise
        control over its trunk, which wiggles around and may cause it to trip. By its second week of
        life, the calf can walk more firmly and has more control over its trunk. After its first month,
        a calf can pick up, hold, and put objects in its mouth, but cannot suck water through the trunk
        and must drink directly through the mouth. It is still dependent on its mother and keeps close

    <p>For its first three months, a calf relies entirely on milk from its mother for nutrition, after
        which it begins to forage for vegetation and can use its trunk to collect water. At the same
        time, improvements in lip and leg coordination occur. Calves continue to suckle at the same
        rate as before until their sixth month, after which they become more independent when feeding.
        By nine months, mouth, trunk and foot coordination is perfected. After a year, a calf's
        abilities to groom, drink, and feed itself are fully developed. It still needs its mother for
        nutrition and protection from predators for at least another year. Suckling bouts tend to last
        2–4 min/hr for a calf younger than a year and it continues to suckle until it reaches three
        years of age or older. Suckling after two years may serve to maintain growth rate, body
        condition and reproductive ability.<sup id="cite_ref-Sukumar126_142-2" class="reference"><a

    <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Communication">Communication</span></h3>

    <p>Touching is an important form of communication among elephants. Individuals greet each other by
        stroking or wrapping their trunks; the latter also occurs during mild competition. Older
        elephants use trunk-slaps, kicks, and shoves to discipline younger ones. Individuals of any age
        and sex will touch each other's mouths, temporal glands, and genitals, particularly during
        meetings or when excited. This allows individuals to pick up chemical cues. Touching is
        especially important for mother–calf communication. When moving, elephant mothers will touch
        their calves with their trunks or feet when side-by-side or with their tails if the calf is
        behind them. If a calf wants to rest, it will press against its mother's front legs and when it
        wants to suckle, it will touch her breast or leg.<sup id="cite_ref-147" class="reference"><a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-147">[147]</a></sup>
    </p>
    <p>Visual displays mostly occur in agonistic situations. Elephants will try to appear more
        threatening by raising their heads and spreading their ears. They may add to the display by
        shaking their heads and snapping their ears, as well as throwing dust and vegetation. They are
        usually bluffing when performing these actions. Excited elephants may raise their trunks.
        Submissive ones will lower their heads and trunks, as well as flatten their ears against their
        necks, while those that accept a challenge will position their ears in a V shape.<sup id="cite_ref-148"

    <p>At Amboseli, several different infrasonic calls have been identified. A greeting rumble is
        emitted by members of a family group after having been separated for several hours. Contact
        calls are soft, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulation" title="Modulation">unmodulated</a>
        sounds made by individuals that have been separated from their group and may be responded to
        with a "contact answer" call that starts out loud, but becomes softer. A "let's go" soft rumble
        is emitted by the matriarch to signal to the other herd members that it is time to move to
        another spot. Bulls in musth emit a distinctive, low-frequency pulsated rumble nicknamed the
        "motorcycle". Musth rumbles may be answered by the "female chorus", a low-frequency, modulated
        chorus produced by several cows. A loud postcopulatory call may be made by an oestrous cow
        after mating. When a cow has mated, her family may produce calls of excitement known as the
        "mating pandemonium".<sup id="cite_ref-Sukumar145_151-1" class="reference"><a

    <p>Elephants are known to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seismic_communication"
            title="Seismic communication">communicate
            with seismics</a>, vibrations produced by impacts on the earth's surface or acoustical
        waves that travel through it. They appear to rely on their leg and shoulder bones to transmit
        the signals to the middle ear. When detecting seismic signals, the animals lean forward and put
        more weight on their larger front feet; this is known as the "freezing behaviour". Elephants
        possess several adaptations suited for seismic communication. The cushion pads of the feet
        contain cartilaginous nodes and have similarities to the acoustic fat found in <a

            class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant#cite_note-seismic-154">[154]</a></sup>
        Elephants appear to use seismics for a number of purposes. An individual running or mock
        charging can create seismic signals that can be heard at great distances.<sup id="cite_ref-155"

        When detecting the seismics of an alarm call signalling danger from predators, elephants enter
        a defensive posture and family groups will pack together. Seismic waveforms produced by
        locomotion appear to travel distances of up to 32&nbsp;km (20&nbsp;mi) while those from
        vocalisations travel 16&nbsp;km (10&nbsp;mi).<sup id="cite_ref-156" class="reference"><a
